# The Factory    Pattern

## Definitions
* **The Factory Method Pattern:**: The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
* **The Abstract Factory Pattern:**: The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes

## Key Concepts
* **Dependency Inversion:** Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.
